This Python script is a basic malware scanner designed to scan files in a specified directory for recognizable malware signatures. It utilizes file I/O operations to read files in binary mode and checks for predefined malware signatures within the file content.

Requirements

    Python 3.x

How to Use

    Git clone this repository
    Define the list of malware signatures you want to scan for in the malware_signatures variable. (Use an EICAR file to test)
    Specify the target directory to scan by setting the target_directory variable.
    Run the python program using your IDE
    The script will traverse the specified directory recursively, scanning each file for malware signatures. If any matching signatures are found, it will indicate the presence of          malicious files.

Note

    This is a basic malware scanner and may not be sufficient for comprehensive malware detection. Consider using specialized antivirus software for robust protection.
    Ensure that you have necessary permissions to access and scan files in the target directory.

This malware scanner provides a simple yet effective means of identifying known malware signatures within files, aiding in the detection and mitigation of potential security threats. By scanning files for recognizable malware patterns, it helps prevent the execution of malicious software on one's system.
